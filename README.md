## Finishing the game

### End of match conditions:
- By number of rounds (odd)
- By revealing the entire board

Each round, each player chooses a row or column on the board and tries to guess the value of its sum.
The closest one will have a revealed house, of the chosen row or column, if the two players have the same approach, both will have a revealed house on the board.

Which house will be revealed depends on the value guessed by the player:
- If the guessed value is less than the sum, the revealed square is the one that contains the smallest value of the chosen row or column.
- If the guessed value is greater than the sum, the revealed square is the one that contains the highest value of the chosen row or column.
- If the guessed value is equal to the sum, all the spaces in the chosen row or column are revealed.
The player with the most houses revealed at the end of the game wins.
